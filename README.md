ABSTRACT : 
###
Funding is crucial for all early stage and mature startups. Investors have their own platforms for VC/ Angel/Crowd funding. Seed funding involves investing in a company in its earliest stage of development. Reaching out to the investors and seed funders had always been a difficult task for startups. So, the main objective of this project is to provide a platform via web application, for those startups seeking investors/funding support. A web application (or web app) is application software that runs on a web server. These applications are accessed by the user through a web browser. In this application we facilitate with an option where the user (Startup) can communicate with the investor via mail. And to store the details of the investor we use MongoDB (database). It is a document-oriented database which stores data in JSON format with dynamic schema. HTML, CSS and JavaScript for creating the User Interface and technologies like Node.js, MongoDB are used.
###
